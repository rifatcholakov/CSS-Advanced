        <p id="reading-paragraph">I love reading. That's an exercise for the brain. I read a new book every 2 weeks or so. As a rule, I always read at least few pages every day. I read books primarily to learn, grow, and feed my curiosities.</p>

        <p>Most of all I love the rush of adrenaline in my body, while doing some wild and crazy. I'm a big fan of extreme sports. I've been bungee jumping, zip lining, free climbing, rafting and I expect to do even more.</p>
