        React is a lightweight JavaScript library created by Facebook that has become highly popular in the recent years. It allows you to build beautiful UIs for your web apps using isolated and reusable building blocks called components.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React also has a huge ecosystem mainly created by third-party developers, including several tools, component libraries, IDEs, extensions for code editors and web browsers, boilerplates, and more. In this article, we have collected the 20 best tools and resources for both beginners and experienced React developers.&lt;/p&gt;
