        Want to make your website faster? Using a content delivery network (CDN) will bring remarkable speed improvements to your website.

    <p>CDN77 is an excellent content delivery network. They’re a customer-centric, performance-focused company that continually enhances their service through the rapid and early adoption of cutting-edge features.</p>
    <p>For example, right now, not a lot of CDNs support Brotli — a Google-led compression format that reduces file sizes 22% better than gzip. CDN77 recently implemented Brotli compression support, which means faster file transfers for users on their CDN.</p>

    <h3>Easy integration with WordPress and other content publishing platforms</h3>
    <p>Using CDN77 can be as easy as installing a plugin. If you’re on WordPress, you have several plugin options such as W3 Total Cache, ZenCache, etc. Learn more here.</p>
    <h3>Better speeds because of HTTP/2 support</h3>
    <p>The newest version of the Web’s standard data-transfer protocol, HTTP/2, is already enabled on CDN77. HTTP/2, according to my test results on http2demo.io, is 63% faster than HTTP.</p>
